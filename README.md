It collects works by Polish literary scholars and literary scholars. All published texts are for the internal use of the Institute of Literary Research due to copyright restrictions.

## Contributors

**Institute of Literary Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences**, [www.ibl.waw.pl](https://ibl.waw.pl/)

## Corpus design
The collected texts come from different sources.
- subcorpus of literary essays
- subcorpus of scientific essays.

### Balancing criteria

*to be added*

### Limitations

- imprecise definition of the population – there is no complete list of essay publications, and the lists that can be compiled from available bibliographic data are not exhaustive
uneven availability of publications in digital form
- copyright – licenses prevent the use of certain texts in corpus work
